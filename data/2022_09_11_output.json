                "description": "Out of the sea, wish I could be... part of that world.\n\nDisney's The Little Mermaid is coming to theaters May 26, 2023.\n\n\u201cThe Little Mermaid,\u201d visionary filmmaker Rob Marshall\u2019s live-action reimagining of the studio\u2019s Oscar\u00ae-winning animated musical classic, opens exclusively in theaters nationwide May 26, 2023. \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d is the beloved story of Ariel, a beautiful and spirited young mermaid with a thirst for adventure. The youngest of King Triton\u2019s daughters, and the most defiant, Ariel longs to find out more about the world beyond the sea, and while visiting the surface, falls for the dashing Prince Eric. While mermaids are forbidden to interact with humans, Ariel must follow her heart. She makes a deal with the evil sea witch, Ursula, which gives her a chance to experience life on land, but ultimately places her life \u2013 and her father\u2019s crown \u2013 in jeopardy. \n\nThe film stars singer and actress Halle Bailey (\u201cgrown-ish\u201d) as Ariel; Tony Award\u00ae winner Daveed Diggs (\u201cHamilton,\u201d \u201cSnowpiercer\u201d) as the voice of Sebastian; Jacob Tremblay (\u201cLuca,\u201d \u201cRoom\u201d) as the voice of Flounder; Awkwafina (\u201cRaya and the Last Dragon\u201d) as the voice of Scuttle; Jonah Hauer-King (\u201cA Dog\u2019s Way Home\u201d) as Prince Eric; Art Malik (\u201cHomeland\u201d) as Sir Grimsby; Noma Dumezweni (\u201cMary Poppins Returns\u201d) as Queen Selina; with Oscar\u00ae winner Javier Bardem (\u201cNo Country for Old Men,\u201d \u201cBeing the Ricardos\u201d) as King Triton; and two-time Academy Award\u00ae nominee Melissa McCarthy (\u201cCan You Ever Forgive Me?\u201d \u201cBridesmaids\u201d) as Ursula.      \n\n\u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d is directed by Oscar\u00ae nominee Rob Marshall (\u201cChicago,\u201d \u201cMary Poppins Returns\u201d), and written by two-time Oscar nominee David Magee (\u201cLife of Pi,\u201d \u201cFinding Neverland\u201d), with a live-action story adaptation by David Magee, Rob Marshall, and two-time Emmy winner John DeLuca (\u201cTony Bennett: An American Classic\u201d), based on the short story by Hans Christian Andersen, and the Disney animated film by Ron Clements and John Musker. The film is produced by two-time Emmy\u00ae winner Marc Platt (\u201cJesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert,\u201d \u201cGrease Live!\u201d), three-time Tony Award\u00ae winner Lin-Manuel Miranda (\u201cHamilton,\u201d \u201cIn the Heights\u201d), Rob Marshall, and John DeLuca, with Jeffrey Silver (\u201cThe Lion King\u201d) serving as executive producer. The score is by multiple Academy Award\u00ae winner Alan Menken (\u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d \u201cAladdin\u201d), who won two Oscars\u00ae for the music in the animated version of \u201cThe Little Mermaid,\u201d with music supervised and produced by Mike Higham (\u201cMary Poppins Returns,\u201d \u201cInto the Woods\u201d).

She had pledged to serve her people, which she fulfilled through a combination of skill and a sense of duty.\n\nIt was during the Second World War that the then Princess Elizabeth gave her first address to the nation, saying that when peace returned, \"it will be for us, the children of today, to make the world of tomorrow a better and happier place\".\n\nShe joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service, the first female in the Royal Family to become a full-time member of the armed forces.\n\nOn victory day in Europe, she appeared on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with her family and Winston Churchill, and later danced on the streets with the crowds, pulling an officer's cap over her eyes so nobody recognised her.\n\nIn 1947, she married Philip Mountbatten, the wedding helping to lift the post-war gloom of austerity and forging a union that lasted 73 years.\n\nNews of the death of her father, George VI, in 1952 reached Elizabeth while she was on safari in Kenya. The following year her coronation was held, with hundreds of thousands of people lining the route to Westminster Abbey and more than 20 million watching on television.\n\nHer reign began with a six-month tour of the Commonwealth. She believed the institution should move away from empire and become more about friendship and equal rights between nations.\n\nShe was delighted when her eldest son, Prince Charles, announced his engagement to Lady Diana Spencer, with their wedding in 1981 becoming a global television event.\n\nBut the breakdown of the relationship, and that of Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, wounded the institution of monarchy, and when Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris in 1997, the Queen faced criticism for remaining at Balmoral with her bereaved grandchildren. When she returned to London, on the eve of Diana's funeral, the Queen gave a personal expression of grief.\n\nIn 2002, she lost her only sibling, Princess Margaret, and then just seven weeks later, her mother.\n\nGolden Jubilee celebrations, marking 50 years on the throne, were held that year. Support for the monarchy had risen, reaching an all-time high when she became the unexpected star of the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nBut there were more difficult times ahead. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle said a lack of support from the Royal Family contributed to the decision the couple made to step away from royal duties.\n\nAnd Prince Andrew was removed from his public roles as the scandal that had started with his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein grew.  \n\nThe Covid pandemic was the biggest global crisis of her long reign. In a rare speech during the first lockdown in 2020, the Queen made it clear that she understood the grief and hardship people were facing, invoking Vera Lynn's wartime classic, We'll Meet Again.\n\nA year later, she had to deal with the death at 99 of Prince Philip, her husband of seven decades and \"rock\".\n\nThe Platinum Jubilee in 2022 marked 70 years on the throne, and despite mobility issues she continued with public duties. \n\nCathy Newman looks back at the life of Queen Elizabeth and how Britain transformed during her reign.",
