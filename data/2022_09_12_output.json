                "description": "The magical teaser trailer for the all-new live-action musical comedy \u201cDisenchanted,\u201d which premiered at the D23 Expo 2022 in the Anaheim Convention Center moments ago, is here! The eagerly-anticipated sequel to \u201cEnchanted,\u201d which reunites original cast members Amy Adams, Patrick Dempsey, Idina Menzel, and James Marsden and also stars Maya Rudolph, Gabriella Baldacchino, Yvette Nicole Brown, and Jayma Mays, is directed by Adam Shankman and features new songs from Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz. \u201cDisenchanted\u201d begins streaming November 24, exclusively on Disney+\u2026just in time to brighten up the holiday season.\n \n\nIt has been 15 years since Giselle (Amy Adams) and Robert (Patrick Dempsey) wed, but Giselle has grown disillusioned with life in the city, so they move their growing family to the sleepy suburban community of Monroeville in search of a more fairy tale life. Unfortunately, it isn\u2019t the quick fix she had hoped for. Suburbia has a whole new set of rules and a local queen bee, Malvina Monroe (Maya Rudolph), who makes Giselle feel more out of place than ever. Frustrated that her happily ever after hasn\u2019t been so easy to find, she turns to the magic of Andalasia for help, accidentally transforming the entire town into a real-life fairy tale and placing her family\u2019s future happiness in jeopardy. Now, Giselle is in a race against time to reverse the spell and determine what happily ever after truly means to her and her family.\n\n\n\u201cDisenchanted stars Amy Adams, Patrick Dempsey, Maya Rudolph, Yvette Nicole Brown, Jayma Mays, Gabriella Baldacchino, with Idina Menzel and James Marsden. Directed by Adam Shankman from a screenplay by Brigitte Hales and a story by J. David Stem & David N. Weiss and Richard LaGravenese, \u201cDisenchanted\u201d is produced by Barry Josephson, Barry Sonnenfeld, and Amy Adams, with Jo Burn, Sunil Perkash, and Adam Shankman serving as executive producers. The movie features songs with music by 8-time Oscar\u00ae-winning composer Alan Menken and lyrics by three-time Oscar-winning lyricist Stephen Schwartz, whose work on \u201cEnchanted\u201d garnered three Academy Award\u00ae nominations and a score by Alan Menken.\n\n\nDisney\u2019s \u201cDisenchanted\u201d begins streaming November 24, 2022, only on Disney+.",

                    "description": "The magical teaser trailer for the all-new live-action musical comedy \u201cDisenchanted,\u201d which premiered at the D23 Expo 2022 in the Anaheim Convention Center moments ago, is here! The eagerly-anticipated sequel to \u201cEnchanted,\u201d which reunites original cast members Amy Adams, Patrick Dempsey, Idina Menzel, and James Marsden and also stars Maya Rudolph, Gabriella Baldacchino, Yvette Nicole Brown, and Jayma Mays, is directed by Adam Shankman and features new songs from Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz. \u201cDisenchanted\u201d begins streaming November 24, exclusively on Disney+\u2026just in time to brighten up the holiday season.\n \n\nIt has been 15 years since Giselle (Amy Adams) and Robert (Patrick Dempsey) wed, but Giselle has grown disillusioned with life in the city, so they move their growing family to the sleepy suburban community of Monroeville in search of a more fairy tale life. Unfortunately, it isn\u2019t the quick fix she had hoped for. Suburbia has a whole new set of rules and a local queen bee, Malvina Monroe (Maya Rudolph), who makes Giselle feel more out of place than ever. Frustrated that her happily ever after hasn\u2019t been so easy to find, she turns to the magic of Andalasia for help, accidentally transforming the entire town into a real-life fairy tale and placing her family\u2019s future happiness in jeopardy. Now, Giselle is in a race against time to reverse the spell and determine what happily ever after truly means to her and her family.\n\n\n\u201cDisenchanted stars Amy Adams, Patrick Dempsey, Maya Rudolph, Yvette Nicole Brown, Jayma Mays, Gabriella Baldacchino, with Idina Menzel and James Marsden. Directed by Adam Shankman from a screenplay by Brigitte Hales and a story by J. David Stem & David N. Weiss and Richard LaGravenese, \u201cDisenchanted\u201d is produced by Barry Josephson, Barry Sonnenfeld, and Amy Adams, with Jo Burn, Sunil Perkash, and Adam Shankman serving as executive producers. The movie features songs with music by 8-time Oscar\u00ae-winning composer Alan Menken and lyrics by three-time Oscar-winning lyricist Stephen Schwartz, whose work on \u201cEnchanted\u201d garnered three Academy Award\u00ae nominations and a score by Alan Menken.\n\n\nDisney\u2019s \u201cDisenchanted\u201d begins streaming November 24, 2022, only on Disney+."

                "description": "Please consider supporting me at https://www.patreon.com/LindsayHoliday\n\nThe United Kingdom has a new King. On September 8th, 2022, at the moment of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s death, Charles, as her eldest son and heir apparent, acceded the throne and became King. Within hours it was announced that he would reign under the regnal name of Charles III, ending years of speculation that he might choose a different moniker, possible that hos his Grandfather, George. Another matter of contention was the title his wife, Camilla would use. That too was cleared up when it was confirmed that she will be Queen Consort. In fact she is England\u2019s first commoner queen consort in 475 years, since Henry VIII died in 1547 and his final wife, Catherine Parr was downgraded to Queen dowager. \rOn the September 10th the accession council meet at St. James\u2019s Palace, as they have since the 1603 to declare Charles King. More about that later. However you may feel about Charles personally or the Monarchy in general, he is the modern link in a chain going back a thousand years. Let\u2019s take a look at the fascinating, often controversial lives of the new King Charles III and Camilla, Queen Consort of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth realms. \n\nCheck out the History Tea Time Podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/7iW8gOI5wb5TNFAIhBd9Om?si=46aeeacd64214ac0\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/history-tea-time/id1619978406\nGoogle: https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy84Yzg1ZWU5MC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw\n\nMusic: Brandenburg Concerto No4-1 BWV1049 - Classical Whimsical by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100303\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/\n\nFor business inquiries, please contact LindsayHoliday@ellify.com",

                    "description": "Please consider supporting me at https://www.patreon.com/LindsayHoliday\n\nThe United Kingdom has a new King. On September 8th, 2022, at the moment of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s death, Charles, as her eldest son and heir apparent, acceded the throne and became King. Within hours it was announced that he would reign under the regnal name of Charles III, ending years of speculation that he might choose a different moniker, possible that hos his Grandfather, George. Another matter of contention was the title his wife, Camilla would use. That too was cleared up when it was confirmed that she will be Queen Consort. In fact she is England\u2019s first commoner queen consort in 475 years, since Henry VIII died in 1547 and his final wife, Catherine Parr was downgraded to Queen dowager. \rOn the September 10th the accession council meet at St. James\u2019s Palace, as they have since the 1603 to declare Charles King. More about that later. However you may feel about Charles personally or the Monarchy in general, he is the modern link in a chain going back a thousand years. Let\u2019s take a look at the fascinating, often controversial lives of the new King Charles III and Camilla, Queen Consort of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth realms. \n\nCheck out the History Tea Time Podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/7iW8gOI5wb5TNFAIhBd9Om?si=46aeeacd64214ac0\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/history-tea-time/id1619978406\nGoogle: https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy84Yzg1ZWU5MC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw\n\nMusic: Brandenburg Concerto No4-1 BWV1049 - Classical Whimsical by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100303\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/\n\nFor business inquiries, please contact LindsayHoliday@ellify.com"
